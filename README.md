## Description

_This is my personal portfolio web page. You can review current and completed projects I have on GitHub, as well as find out a little more about me. The initial purpose of this site is to practice and showcase what I learned during the first week of Epicodus classes learning HTML and CSS. The site will be updated over time to reflect additional skills and further completed projects.
