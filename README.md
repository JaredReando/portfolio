# _{Personal Web Portfolio}_

#### _{Simple portfolio web page introducing myself and my coding content to the world.}, {October 12, 2018}_

#### By _**{Jared Reando}**_

## Description

_{This is my personal portfolio web page. You can review current and completed projects on GitHub, as well as find out a little more about me. The initial purpose of this site is to practice and showcase what I learned during the first week of classes learning HTML and CSS. The site will be updated over time to reflect additional skills and further completed projects. In the meantime, consider this a (very!) rough draft.  }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_

## Known Bugs

_{Still learning how to properly nest and space content. Text and formatting look a little odd, and I can't quite get the background image to scale the way I'd like with the rest of the page content. Overall, the site is embarrassingly bad in its current state. Will update further before grading on Tuesday.}_

## Support and contact details

_{Please direct all constructive criticism and frenzied praise to my personal email: jaredreando@gmail.com}_

## Technologies Used

_{My main goal with this project was to wrap my head around <div> tags and nested rows and columns. I also experimented at length with the site's aesthetic possibilities by adjusting object opacities, image scaling, and element positioning. Custom classes to override/modify Bootstrap features were also a major part of my work on this project, as I am still plodding through the CSS and Bootstrap documentation to learn it's expanded feature set.}_
